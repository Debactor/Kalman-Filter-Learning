# VBN_Task2
This repository contains the code files for the kalman filter estimation of a moving robot in ideal conditions with uniform velocity the state (position and velocity) of which is measured by a GPS sensor.

The sensor is modelled with white noise and it is assumed that there are no drag forces or any forces acting on the bot.
